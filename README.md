# Coronalysis-Project
It is a Data Analytics Project where I used numerous Python Libraries like Matplotlib,Pandas,Seaborn,Numpy etc.


This project aims to predict the future conditions of India by visualizing available datasets in the form of graphs, bar graphs and pie charts which can aid experts and law makers in defining the future course of actions to fight against coronavirus using Pandas for data manipulation, Numpy for numerical computation and Matplotlib for visualization with Seaborn for better and interactive visualization.
